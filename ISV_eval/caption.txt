You are responsible for writing a detailed description of a video by which a testee will assess the quality of the video. Look at the video and write the transcript according to the following instructions.

To ensure the testee has a comprehensive understanding of the specific shot they are assessing, it is essential to extract and describe all the key elements of the shot in a detailed manner. The goal is to provide the testee with enough context to evaluate the shot accurately in relation to the overall narrative, aesthetic, and emotional impact.

Here’s a detailed instruction guide for transcribing a shot and writing its description:

Detailed Instruction for Shot Description:

⸻

1. Shot Identification and Context

1.1. Shot Number/Scene
	•	Contextualize the shot by identifying the scene and shot number in the movie (e.g., “Scene 15, Shot 3”). If possible, include the time stamp of the shot (e.g., “10:34 – 10:40”).

1.2. Scene Summary
	•	Provide a brief overview (1-2 sentences) of the scene where the shot is located. This should include:
	•	The setting (e.g., urban street, living room).
	•	The key event or action taking place (e.g., character confrontation, discovery of an object).
	•	Mention of the main characters involved in the shot, even if not in direct focus.

Example:
“Scene 15 depicts a tense confrontation between the protagonist (Alice) and the antagonist (John) in a dark alley. In this shot, Alice is backing away, while John approaches menacingly.”

2. Shot Composition and Cinematography

2.1. Camera Angle
	•	Describe the angle at which the camera is positioned relative to the subject.
	•	Eye level: The camera is placed at the character’s eye level, creating a neutral or balanced perspective.
	•	High angle: The camera looks down at the subject, often conveying a sense of vulnerability or inferiority.
	•	Low angle: The camera looks up at the subject, often conveying power, dominance, or superiority.
	•	Dutch angle (tilt): The camera is tilted sideways, often used to indicate disorientation, unease, or tension.

2.2. Shot Size/Framing
	•	Describe the size of the shot and how it frames the subject:
	•	Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Focuses on a small detail, often a facial feature or object.
	•	Close-Up (CU): Shows a character’s face, typically used for emotional intensity.
	•	Medium Shot (MS): Typically shows the character from the waist up, allowing for interaction between characters.
	•	Long Shot (LS): The full body of a character or wide scene showing environmental context.
	•	Extreme Long Shot (ELS): A wide view of the scene, often used to establish location.

2.3. Camera Movement
	•	Describe any camera movement used in the shot:
	•	Tracking/Dolly: The camera moves along with the subject, often used to follow action.
	•	Zoom: The lens changes focus to either zoom in or out on the subject, altering the perceived proximity.
	•	Tilt/Pan: The camera tilts up or down (tilt) or pans left or right (pan) without moving its position.
	•	Handheld: The camera shakes slightly, creating a sense of immediacy or chaos.

Example:
“The shot is a medium shot (MS) at eye level, with a slow zoom-in on Alice’s face as she reacts in fear. The camera starts with a slight handheld shake, adding tension to the moment.”
