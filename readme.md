## Interleaved Scene Graph

<img src="figures/benchmark.png">

This evaluation method and benchmark is designed for evaluating interleaved generation in four levels: Structural, Block, Image, and Holistic. It is an well established testbed for model can perform both multimodal understanding and generation such as [Show-o](https://github.com/showlab/Show-o) and [Anole](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/anole).

### Environment Setup
Given that we mainly use GPT-4o for VQA in *Image* and *Block* level as well as MLLM-as-a-Judge in *Holistic* level, you can simply setup by: `pip install openai`.

### Repository Management

```markdown
/ISG_eval
├── images (You should download it from huggingface and place here)
├── ISG-Bench.jsonl
├── ...
```

1. **images**: Contains images in queries and golden answer. You can download it from [here](https://) and place them under ISG_eval.

2. **ISG-Bench.jsonl**: Contains ground truth compiled previously by ISG. One data sample is as follows. It contains `Query` for question and `Golden` for human-annotated golden answer.

```json
{
    "id": "0000",
    "Category": "Prediction",
    "Query": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "I will give you a picture of a person washing their hands. Please use a combination of 4 images and text to show what will happen next. Please generate an overall description first, then directly generate adjacent image blocks. For example, [whole description] <object1 image> <object2 image> <object3 image> <object4 image>."
        },
        {
            "type": "image",

    ],
    "Golden": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The person continues to scrub their hands thoroughly, with the soap lathering up. The hands are cleaned under running water, and the lather is rinsed away."

                ...
            ]
        }
    }
}

## Evaluating Your Own Model

<img src="figures/case_study.png">
Once you get your model's output, manage them as a JsonLine file, where each the answer for each id is under key `output`:

```json
{
    "id": "0000",
    "Category": "Prediction",
    "output": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "<text-content>"
        },
        {
            "type": "image",
            "content": "<path_of_the_input_image>"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then, run the following script:

```shell
python ISG-eval.py --input_file <your file>
python summarize_performance.py --input_file <output of ISG-eval.py>
```

## ISG-Agent: Exploring the Upper Bound for Interleaved Generation

<img src="figures/agent.png">
ISG-Agent is a compositional framework that leverage tools to generate high-quality interleaved content while strictly follows user's query. 

<img src="figures/Agent_Result.jpeg">
ISG-Agent will output interleaved image and text results. You can run evaluation on ISG-Agent.

Please See `ISG_agent/README.md` for enviroment setup and how to use. You can also reproduct the experiment result by comparing to the chart.

|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Block      | ISG-AGENT | 5.515 | 5.391 | 6.181 | 6.081 | 4.243 | 6.408  | 6.816 | 5.678 | 3.321 |
