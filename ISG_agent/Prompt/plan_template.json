  "Script Writing": "\n    Write the plays based on the scripts in the previous scripting step. Each play should have clear boundary and extremely simple motion and setup, \n    Here a ''play`` is not what is common in operas or in theatre or in movies, a play is just a fragment of the development of the current situation, \n    which is coherent with both the preceding and the following act to make the whole story both logically and visually consistent.\n    ",
  "Casting Design": "\n    Select and hire actors. For each character in the script, create a detailed casting requirement sheet, including descriptions of age, gender, nationality, time period, skin color, appearance, clothing, and other relevant details.\n    Particularly, ensure that the character's physical appearance is described in great detail. This character may be a fictional one that does not exist in reality.\n    ",
  "Casting Extraction": "\n    Extract the casting requirement sheets from the casting and equipment sections and generate a JSON object for further processing.
